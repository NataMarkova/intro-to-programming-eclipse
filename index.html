About
I work as a Quality Assurance Engineer in a Silicon Valley startup. I love my job and passionate about finding bugs in a software. For testing purposes I use both automation on JavaScript and mannualy.
I've been studying in CDT more than a year. I've taken the Ruby on Rails class and have participated in the project called Not Along.
Now I'd like to be more tech savvy which is why I'm taking Intro to Programming class.
